Am I a better adult because my parents micro-managed me as a kid?

As parents, our over riding instinct is to keep our little creation safe. We gasp and reach to catch them at the slightest tumble. We sit and do their school project with them so they’re not that kid carrying a bag of hot mess to school. We say no when, aged 4, they ask to help cook dinner, because it’s not safe! We keep the TV off so as not to ruin their brain development. We tell them what they must eat to keep them healthy and insist they put more layers on when we feel it’s too cold outside for what they have chosen to wear. But is any of this bad? Or is it exactly your duty as mummy/daddy?
I spent the first decade of my life being raised by a veritable whole village. I had no mum/dad but many I could count on as a parent. 

Collectively, this village taught me to be independent, entrepreneurial, loving, resilient, fun loving and brave. The second decade of my life was spent with the woman who gave birth to me. Her approach to parenting definitely fell into the micro-managed category. Every aspect of my life was so accounted for that I actually had a timetable of what I was supposed to be doing from the moment I woke up right up until the minute I went to bed.

These friends, rather than abusing the freedom given to them by their parents, led balanced lives where they would party hard, after studying hard and putting in a shift in their weekend jobs. This observation imprinted in my mind solidly.

Over the years, it’s been fascinating watching my friends and acquaintances in their approach to managing the whole parenting job. Remember there is no real definitive manual on this one crucial but unpaid job. Sure there are loads of parenting books but none of them can fully prepare you for the delightfully uniqueness of every child born.

As a former micromanaged child myself, I can speak with authority when I say this kind of child has little to no confidence as they’ve been conditioned to believe they can’t do anything without approval. They can find it hard to regulate their emotions and can lack resilience as they haven’t had a chance to develop this, due to an over-reliance on mum/dad for so much in their formative years. They struggle to make judgement calls as mummy or daddy always thinks for them. Others will rage against this constant control and play up massively when their ‘ruler’ isn’t around.

It can be a horribly destructive way to bring up a child and often demonstrates a need for that parent to deal with their own childhood issues relating to control.
