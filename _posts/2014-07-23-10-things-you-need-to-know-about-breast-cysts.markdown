The recent discovery of an unusual lumpy mass in my right breast had me running superfast to my doctors who referred me to the hospital for a scan.  I got an appointment very quickly and the scan identified the lumpy mass to be hormonal cysts. Nothing to worry about, no real definitive causes and no real cures according to the consultants but the holistic warrior in me wanted to know more so I dug further. Here are 10 things you should know about unusual lumps in your breasts:

1. Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs and are common in women aged 35-50 years (although younger women and men can also get them)
1. Although no specific causes can be cited for definite, hormonal changes in the body are thought to be the most common cause of benign (i.e. non-cancerous) lumps in breasts
1. Benign breast lumps do not increase your risk of nor develop into breast cancer
1. Some people with cysts may not feel any symptoms and others may feel symptoms ranging from pain in either breast, sunken nipples, dimpling on the skin of the breast, a rash on or around the nipple or a change in the size of  the breast
1. The size of the cysts vary from miniscule to several centimetres in diameter. It is also possible to have one or several cysts in one or both breasts
1. Screening is a simple process involving an ultrasound scan, mammogram and in some cases inspiration of the cyst (where sample tissue is taken and further examined)
1. It is thought that reducing your intake of caffeine, chocolate and fatty or fried foods can improve the condition.  There are also a lot of studies that link breast cancer to dioxin (an environmental pollutant) and other heavy metals we are exposed to on a daily basis as these pollutants tend to accumulate in fatty tissue. Avoid drinking water and soft drinks sold in plastic bottles and where possible use skincare products that contain no parabens.
1. Other holistic remedies include increasing intake of vitamin E, evening primrose oil, iodine and vitamin B6 which is particularly good for liver function. An impaired liver function can mean an excess of hormones in the body which can be stored as, for example, cysts in the breast
1. Therapeutic massages such as the Tibetan breast massage stimulates the endocrine system to balance the female hormones as well as keeping the tissue from getting overly congested
1. Regularly feel your breasts, either in the shower/bath or during the moisturising part of your beauty regime. This is your best chance at spotting any changes in the shape etc of your breasts. Some changes are a natural part of whatever is going on in your life at that time (pregnancy, monthly cycle, aging etc) and some changes need medical attention. The only way to know for sure is to get it checked out and quickly!
2. Early diagnosis could be live saving.  More info can be found from the NHS’s website here:  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Breast-lump/Pages/Introduction.aspx

Since my scan, I stopped drinking cocoa every night, stopped drinking my beloved Earl Grey tea, ate less chicken and used even less oil in my cooking than I already did.  Why? Well the first three items are known to be high in compounds that interfere with hormone levels in the body and too much fat in your diet can put your liver under stress which means it works less effectively.

I also started taking evening primrose oil, a B vitamin complex and Omega oils supplements.  I also did a juice cleanse using different combinations of ginger, beetroot, mint, celery and turmeric along with green leafy vegetables.  Within a few weeks of making these changes, the unusual lump in my breast has completely disappeared!! I can’t believe it either. Clearly I needed to clean out my organs…
