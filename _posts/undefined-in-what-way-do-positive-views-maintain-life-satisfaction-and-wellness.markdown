intro: "As a wellness practitioner, one of the first things I help clients to explore and define is their outlook. Not just on life but everything they hold dear. Because one of the best lessons I learned myself is that we choose how we feel. How we respond to things that happen to us. How we react to any situation. And yet in order to do this, you need a veritable toolkit you can refer to that will equip you damn well in any situation.\nOne of the biggest reasons The Secret was a phenomenal success was its basic premise that if you focus on your dreams and maintain a positive attitude, those said dreams will come true. Millions of people swore this was an amazing revelation to their lives and numerous others will tell you it didn’t work out so good for them. The response to the, shall we say, ‘failures’ is that they didn’t remove all doubt and negativity from their thoughts.\nWhat I loved about The Secret wasn’t just that the week I started reading it, I managed to visualise and manifest a free cup of chai latte on my morning stop at the coffee shop, but it totally inspired me to have a more positive outlook. (Hey, I’m easily pleased. Some visualised big houses, I was happy with a free latte!)\nOne of the most shared quotes illustrates this simple truth — “If you think you can do a thing or think you can’t do a thing, you’re right.” — Henry Ford. Whatever you choose to believe, that will be your reality.\nYou just need to look at some of the top athletes and most successful people in the world to see this in practice. Each one will tell you that the key to their success isn’t just training but remaining extremely focussed and having a positive mindset. You see, no serious competitor is going to allow the possibility of failure to float in their head. There is no room for doubt. They absolutely must remain focussed on being the winner. This fuels their performance and gives them the much needed confidence to battle through the match/race etc. Especially during moments when they are losing. As a tennis fan, Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic have displayed some of the best examples of unfailing winning mentality I’ve ever seen. I’ve watched both on the losing end of a match and somehow retain their composure and pull a win out the bag — against the run of play. Pure positive mental attitude.\nI have a client who is wheelchair-bound and another who is almost totally blind. I help them exercise in the gym every week and they totally inspire me. Both are very young and don’t let their disability get in the way of having a life lived to the full. In fact they have much better social calendars than a lot of able bodied folk I know! What they both have in common is their attitude to life. Yes, they have days that their situation gets them down. They have to encounter appalling ignorance on many occasions from people who sometimes don’t know how to approach them. But overall, they focus on the many positives in their lives and get on with living a life as full as possible.\nWellness seems to be one of the buzzwords of 2017 but many of us have been practicing this for decades. We are now living in times where health and fitness is entrenched in daily living. Mindfulness is the other buzzword that seeks to teach people the importance of perspective. Then came wellness which seems to be the catch-all term for everything.\nNow, being satisfied with your life and being well are two slightly different things although one can affect the other. Each one of us will have different criteria for being satisfied with life. And each one of us will define our wellness according to different scales. For the person who is chronically ill, a pain-free day/week equals success for them. For someone with no health issues, their wellness might be defined through the satisfaction they feel from drinking a green smoothie daily, exercising and eating ‘clean’.\nJane might be very satisfied with her life because she has a dream job, is living an awesome life dating different guys every week and gets to travel the world. Jo might be equally as satisfied with her life as a housewife and daily routine mapped around her family’s needs. It’s all she ever wanted. Both may encounter challenges in their lives but probably choose to focus on the numerous positives of the dream life they have carved for themselves. On the other hand, you may get two other people with similar lives who feel completely unsatisfied with their lives.\nIt’s a question of perspective and what you choose to focus on. It takes practice, lots of flexibility to modify any long-held views as needed and buckets of resilience."
