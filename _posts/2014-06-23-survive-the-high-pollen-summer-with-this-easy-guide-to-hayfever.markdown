intro: "I used to watch my younger sister every year, suffering with wretched symptoms of hayfever and feel so bad for her. Her eyes would literally puff up like a frog from the constant itch scratch cycle and then she would constantly slap at her ears to try and relieve the itching in her inner ear canal. Then when I was in my early 20s, I also started experiencing this miserable condition.\n"

Both my babies were born in spring which meant I was breasfeeding during the summer and couldn’t take any anti-histamines.  Since then I have been looking at alternative remedies and ways of reversing my symptoms. After all, I wasn’t born with this!

First I looked at why some of us are afflicted with this allergy while others just blithely go through every summer without one sneeze or itch.

Our body’s symptomatic reaction as hay fever occurs when the immune system mistakes airborne substances such as dust, pollen and pollution as a threat.  Our body then produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E to attack what it thinks are harmful substances trying to come inside it. It then releases the chemical histamine which causes the itching, runny nose and watery eyes etc. This is the body’s way of trying to get rid of what it thinks are toxins.
There are seasonal hay fever triggers which include pollen and spores that will cause symptoms during certain months of the year as follows:

* Tree pollen tends to affect people between March and June
* Grass pollen tends to affect people between May and September
* Weed pollen tends to affect people in the autumn (fall)

Additionally, those of us living in the city, especially fairly green and leafy cities such as London, can suffer worse than those in the country as the heat and fumes from cars can trap pollen in the atmosphere.  Combine the presence of numerous high rise buildings and warm, dry, airless weather and you get a situation where these pesky pollen have no way of dispersing into the atmosphere as they normally would so they fall down on us instead!

This year, as the summer has been so late in coming in the UK, experts say there is an even greater buildup of pollen in the atmosphere and predict this summer to be the worst for hayfever in the last 50 years.

Naturopaths and nutritionists believe that one of the main reasons a quarter of the population suffers from this allergy is due to a weak immune system, directly linked to excess toxins in the digestive system.

So what can you do about all this? Well for a start you can take note of foods you eat that are high in histamine. It makes sense to steer clear of these foods especially during the allergy season so that you don’t add to the histamine your body will try and produce in response to pollen attacking it.


Below is a list of some of the common foods that are high in histamine:

* Pickled, tinned, canned, preserved foods
* Cheese: especially matured and hard cheese – the more matured the more histamine
* Tomatoes
* Smoked, cured meat, cured ham, salami
* Most fish products (all shell fish), especially preserved fish products
* Beans and pulses/legumes (especially chickpeas and soy beans, also peanuts)
* Soy products (soy milk, soy cream, tofu, soy sauce)
* Wheat products (bread, cakes, biscuits etc)
* Pickles
* Ready meals
* Some fruit varieties (banana, pears, aubergines, oranges, kiwi, strawberries)
* Alcohol, especially wine and beer
* Yeast
* Black tea
* Chocolate, cocoa
* Sweets with preservatives and/or food colourings
* Malt vinegar
* Nuts


So now we know what causes the symptoms and what foods to avoid, what are the best remedies (aside from anti-histamine tablets)?  From low-histamine foods, helpful vitamins and homeopathic remedies, it can be a lengthy (not to mention expensive) process of finding what works best for you. Below are some of the treatments some people swear by:

Eating low-histamine food such as:

* Vitamin C-rich foods such as kiwi, citrus and papaya
* Dark green, leafy vegetables
* Deep yellow and orange vegetables
* Nettles, bamboo shoots, cabbage, beets, carrots, yams
* Onions, garlic, ginger, cayenne, horseradish, licorice
* Pineapple
* Turmeric
* Probiotics
* Camomile, butterbur and peppermint
* Fresh fish, meat and poultry. The older the produce, the more histamine builds up in it!


Taking immune-boosting supplements, vitamins and minerals such as:

* Bioflavonoids (e.g., quercetin, catechin, and hesperidin)
* Flaxseed oil
* Probiotics (e.g. lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus).  Probiotics are bowel microflora organisms—microscopic bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines.
