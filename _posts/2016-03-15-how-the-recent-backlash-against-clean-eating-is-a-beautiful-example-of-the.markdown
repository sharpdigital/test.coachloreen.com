intro: 'Clean eating this. Kale that. Is it really good for everyone to eat like this? Opinion is slowly changing.'
content: "Almost 7 years ago I gave birth to my first child (followed very quickly by child number two just twelve months later!!!). Their birth re-awakened a long-held interest in me in how the body works. I couldn’t help wondering how milk alone could sustain a life and was fascinated with the changing nutritional needs of a human body as it evolves from a baby into a little person. I also had no real interest in going back into the corporate world as a corporate communications consultant so I decided to follow my passion and learn about all things wellness and offer my services as a health coach.\n\nMy journey has been one of never-ending learning, so much so that I have taken the cautious approach of not jumping on the blogging bandwagon and regurgitating articles from the internet on things I had no actual scientific training in (like a lot of the people who seemed to write on the topic!)\n\nGreen smoothie anyone? Eat kale or die!!\nSo you can imagine how smug I was feeling when I came across article after article this week where the whole ‘clean eating’ phenomenon appeared to be experiencing a derailment. I watched the BBC’s Horizon programme earlier this week where Dr Giles Yeo examined the origins of this approach to wellness and how the claims made by its core ambassadors (the Deliciously Ellas and Helmsley sisters of this world, to name a few) stacked up. For you see, I had always felt that the whole ‘clean eating’ movement was a bit of a fad and not only that, it was blithely confusing people who were desperate for information on how to improve their lives.\n\nHashtag ‘clean’\nInitially I, like millions of people, thought the philosophy of eating ‘clean’ made sense. If, like me, you experience excruciating abdominal pain soon after eating breakfast cereal (sugared wheat/corn swimming in cow’s milk), it made sense to remove dairy, wheat and sugar from your diet. It also makes lots of sense to eat food freshly prepared, using real fruit and vegetables as opposed to a ready meal packed full of ingredients that didn’t come off a tree or out of the ground but instead was made in a food lab.

I loved learning all this new stuff but guess what happened? The more I learned, the more confused I became. I remember reading books by two different ‘experts’, both of them with medical qualifications, about nutrition, both with evidence to back up their body of research and both with very reasoned and logical conclusions. Only problem was they totally contradicted each other! From that moment on, I decided the best approach is to take everything with a pinch of salt and never accept one view.\n\nBecause this is what has come to pass in literally just the last couple of years: the public health guidance on only eating low fat to maintain a good weight turned out to be a load of total BS. Low fat in fact turns out makes you more likely to gain weight due to all the sugar added in to food that had all the fat removed to make it taste half decent. Having told us for years to avoid fat like the plague, the so called health experts were now telling us sheepishly that this wasn’t actually correct.\n\nRemember the whole hype about kale, yes that so-called superfood you had to make sure you ate or wouldn’t have that ‘alkaline’ body and would therefore get sick? This was a major PR campaign by the creators of this crop to basically sell more of it. Kale is no more a superfood than any other green vegetable. What they all have in common is the high levels of anti-oxidants which we all know is great for the body. So it didn’t need to be kale. Could have been lettuce, spring greens, spinach etc.\n\nSugar is your enemy! Sugar is satan! Sugar is poison. This is the new mass believe being pushed that I fully cannot abide. I have an upcoming post on the sugar backlash so I won’t go into it now. Point being, we were encouraged to eat a diet high in sugar for years and now we’re being told it’s the cause of everything that’s wrong with our health. OK then\nYou get the idea. Today’s biggest health movement can become next year’s biggest thing that makes everyone peep out of their hands and squirm and deny that they followed such a foolish notion. This is exactly what appears to be happening with clean eating this week. The very doyennes of the movement are fully distancing themselves of it. Oh no! We didn’t say you should do blah… We were just sharing what worked for us. Yah. And so those of us who were fully jealous of all the money and fame they were enjoying, from their many posts as ‘experts’ on better health, clap our hands in glee and indulge in a little schadenfreude.\n\nI’m not being too smug mind you. The logic behind the fad was fairly sound but over time has been shown to affect people in quite negative ways. Some claim it fuelled their anorexia, some claimed it messed them up as these blogs just made them feel even worse about themselves. I personally identified with the philosophy because of my own intolerances to certain foods. \n\nBut I’m not one for moving with the crowd. I also believe you should seek alternative views to every view you come across and keep an open mind. Then you are not a slave to one way of thinking.

Green smoothie anyone? Eat kale or die!!
So you can imagine how smug I was feeling when I came across article after article this week where the whole ‘clean eating’ phenomenon appeared to be experiencing a derailment. I watched the BBC’s Horizon programme earlier this week where Dr Giles Yeo examined the origins of this approach to wellness and how the claims made by its core ambassadors (the Deliciously Ellas and Helmsley sisters of this world, to name a few) stacked up.

Hashtag ‘clean’
Initially I, like millions of people, thought the philosophy of eating ‘clean’ made sense. If, like me, you experience excruciating abdominal pain soon after eating breakfast cereal (sugared wheat/corn swimming in cow’s milk), it made sense to remove dairy, wheat and sugar from your diet. It also makes lots of sense to eat food freshly prepared, using real fruit and vegetables as opposed to a ready meal packed full of ingredients that didn’t come off a tree or out of the ground but instead was made in a food lab. It spurred me into learning more about things like trans fats, MSG, artificial sweeteners and so on the list goes on things to avoid if you didn’t want to drop down dead instantly from not eating ‘clean’!
