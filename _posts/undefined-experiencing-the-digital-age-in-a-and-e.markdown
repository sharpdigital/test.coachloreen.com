intro: "Experiencing the digital age in A&E\nOn Wednesday night, my daughter presented with a very high temperature and was unusually thirsty. So much so that she drank all the water I left on her bedside table (a rarity in itself as she’s not a huge fan of the stuff) then wet the bed. Again, that was very peculiar for her. Anyway I gave her some painkiller, changed the sheets and put her back to bed thinking everything will be fine in the morning. A very unsettled night, however, foretold what was to come. She was far from well the next day and I duly took her to the doctors as she was complaining of a headache, earache, sore throat and was far from her usual bubbly self. I also knew there was a lot of bugs going round the school so I just wanted to check if she had an actual infection.\nThe visit to the doctor proved fruitless. No infection was detected in her ear or throat so we were sent home with the info that perhaps a virus was ‘brewing’. Interesting. By Saturday, the cycle of super high temperature, headache and chills (despite administering plenty of fluids and painkiller) was worrying. So finally I called 111, the UK’s NHS Direct service, where a very helpful triage assistant asked me a load of questions after which she advised me to take my daughter straight to the hospital and present at the Urgent Care Centre unit. Once upon a time, the call handler would have dispatched an ambulance to your home to deal with this emergency, yet nowadays so much time and resources are saved by going through this preliminary process and encouraging you to take yourself to one of several medical centres near your home.\nThe Urgent Care Centre at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Greenwich is adjacent to it’s Accident & Emergency section. Confusingly, the helpful lady on the phone had told me to go straight to the UCC but we were then redirected back to A&E to check in before coming back to the UCC to wait to be seen by a doctor. Several people came in like we did then had to be redirected to get booked in. Other than this, the whole system was fairly seamless and our visit lasted less than two hours. After checking in, a triage nurse asked me some of the same questions I had already answered on the phone.\nWe then waited for the doctor to call us; who asked the same questions again and checked her out (same as the triage nurse had done less than 45 minutes previously). Other than a slightly swollen gland on one side of her jaw, nothing major was evident and the doctor helped us obtain our prescription through — wait for it — a vending machine! OK so for some of you this isn’t new. I am aware these machines were trialled some years back and as I generally avoid the emergency services unless absolutely necessary, I had NO idea our hospitals were using these futuristic medical marvels. He simply touched some icons on the touch screen interface and out popped our antibiotics. I almost felt like the classic JJC (Johnny Just Come) as I watched this all unfold. I remembered the stories my parents would tell of newcomers (from Africa) to Western cities who would be so amazed by things they had never seen before, such as escalators, that they would proclaim it was witchcraft! In some cases, point blank refusing to use things like escalators or revolving doors for fear of being harmed by some unseen entity. Some of the funniest stories I heard my folks tell were of such occurrences. And right then as the prescription was dispensed without the need for a pharmacy, I felt just like the proverbial JJC."
