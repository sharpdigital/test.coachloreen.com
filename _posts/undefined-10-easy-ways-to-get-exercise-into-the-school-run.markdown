intro: "10 Easy ways to get exercise into the school run\n\nFinding time to exercise is a never-ending challenge for some of us, especially if you are tasked with juggling a career, managing the family’s cooking, cleaning and endless lists of chores. For some people it’s the best excuse never to do it.\nIt is generally recommended that adults aged 18–64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/\nThe key to this is chunking manageable minutes of meaningful physical activity throughout each day. It also helps to know what ‘meaningful physical activity’ is. Think of anything you do that makes you breathless (and not because you are suffering from asthma or a similar condition!), e.g. heavy gardening, housework, steady paced walking, cycling, working out, or even using the stairs instead of the elevator.\nKeep reading for more ways you can get breathless, especially if you are the one doing the school run:\nLiven your morning up with a 4 minute tabata:\nThis is the Japanese approach to high intensity interval work outs that literally takes 4 minutes to complete. Pick one or two exercises such as jumping jacks, high knees, jumping squats or jogging on the spot. Do the exercise at the fastest pace you can manage for 20 seconds then rest for 10 seconds. You do this a total of 8 rounds without stopping which adds up to 4 minutes. If you are totally deconditioned, start with 4 rounds which will only take 2 minutes. This approach to exercise has been proven by doctors and scientists to get you fitter than hours and hours in the gym. As you get fitter, you can do multiple rounds of 4 minutes. There are also various apps in your app store which can do the timing for you. I like to use Hardfox Tabata.\n2. If you consider yourself ‘hard’, try some press ups just before you get in the bath\nPlace your hands on the edge of your bath, ensure your back is straight and your hips are in line with your shoulder. Your body will be tilted at an angle as you aim to lower your whole body towards the bath, focussing on your upper body taking up the majority of your weight. Hold your stomach in and see how many you can do. Try to double that amount by the end of the week.\n3. While waiting at the school gates, practice your pelvic floor exercises.\nOur pelvic floor muscle is essential to our core strenght. Our core muscle is instrumental in our ability to balance and do so much more than you realise. This muscle weakens as we get older and for those of us who have had babies, we are more at risk of having a weak or damaged pelvic floor. To keep the pelvic floor tight, simply squeeze and hold yourself in as if you are desperate to pee but holding it in. Do this for a count of 10 several times. There is an aid called a Kegel that women can use to facilitate this too. The beauty of this is no one can see you doing this exercise! You can do it as you stand, while you are driving, while you walk through the aisles of the supermarket picking up your groceries, while you’re cooking, doing homework with the kids…. You get the idea. Men can do this exercise too as we are all at risk of incontinence as we reach old age.\n4. Multi tasking fitness with kitchen duties\nHow many squats or push ups can you do while the milk is warming up or while the bread is toasting? Do 5 more the next day! This is a challenge you can easily set yourself. Do it to any chore you care to.\n5. Squeeze 5 minutes of a workout in while your little one is getting dressed\nHow many star jumps can you squeeze in while you are waiting for the little darlings to finish their breakfast, finish getting dressed or find their school bag? You know that last 10 minutes that you seem to be waiting interminably for your little loves to be ready so you can leave the house — this is a great opportunity to up your active minutes for the day.\n6. How many times can you go up and down the stairs while you are brushing your teeth?\nA lady I worked with once said she lost tens of kilos by simply going up and down her stairs every day. She would do it while she was brushing her teeth, while she was getting dressed and also find pockets of time in the day to challenge herself. She started with 5 flights and gradually increased the amount every day until she was doing 100 flights at a time! If there are no stairs where you live, do some squats while you are brushing your teeth. Every day you can challenge yourself to do 2 more than you did the day before.\n7. After dropping the darlings to school, lunge back home if you’re only around the corner (or lunge to the station if you’re heading on to work)\nOk so I appreciate that this suggestion is a tad way out, but give it a go — you may just love it. Don’t worry about folks looking at you like you need therapy. They’re just jealous they didn’t think of it :).\n\nYour little darlings might even get involved too!\n8. Jog on the spot outside the kids bedroom to encourage them to wake up\nThe alarm has gone off. You have yelled more times than you care to count. And still they won’t stir. The clock is ticking and you want to avoid the daily last minute rushing that goes on due to your little darlings not getting up when you called them. A friend of mine says she stopped using her loud hailer after several complaints from the neighbours and her own rising stress levels. Instead, she steals some exercise time by jogging on the spot as fast as she can. This makes enough of an irritating noise to wake up her brood within about two minutes AND she gets to burn off a few calories. WIN-WIN.\n9. Skip while the children are doing their homework\nGranted this one may prove difficult if you have toddlers that need your support while they do their school work. Aim for 1-minute sprints of skipping throughout the whole time the children are doing their home work. Then set yourself a target of 5–10 sprints to ensure you raise your heart rate enough to get you breathless.\n10. Unless you really need to drive, leave the car at home and walk.\nYour little ones can hop on their scooter or bikes and get some active minutes into their day too. You can do intervals of fast paced walking while the little ones scoot or ride along. If you have a push bike/scooter yourself, why not make it a family affair and all of you ride/scoot to school?"
