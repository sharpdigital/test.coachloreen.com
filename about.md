I have worked with many businesses in achieving their financial and business goals. Yet the hundreds of people I help to achieve their health and wellbeing goals are absolutely way more inspiring.

I started my professional life in corporate communications and have more than 15 years experience managing clients for media agencies providing PR services, strategic counsel and digital marketing services.

Then I qualified 10 years ago as a life coach and have since worked with a range of people to make changes in their lives that they didn't think was possible. We all need a cheerleader, a person we can rely on to push us to be our better selves. Usain Bolt is not the world champion he is without the team of coaches around him who bring out the best in him.

We live in times when stress and mental illness is rife. We have the best medicine the human race has ever known and food in abundance  yet so many are suffering with ill physical and mental health. The information available on what to eat and exercise is confusing and at times misleading.

I take a simple, bespoke approach with each client to help achieve their unique health goal. As well as a life coach, I am a master personal trainer with qualifications in exercise referral, lower back pain, pre/post-natal exercise, COPD and diabetes and obesity management. My knowledge on nutrition means you won't get a faddy diet to follow - just simple, tailored guidance on what is best for YOU to eat.

You're on this page because you are ready to change. You've thought about it long and hard and now you are ready to do something about it and want someone who knows what the heck they are doing to help you do it. So let's do it!
