Calorie counting is misunderstood and causes of obesity tend to be too simplistically characterised. I am trained in nutrition and hold a level 4 in Exercise for Obesity and Diabetes. Good nutrition and physical activity is personal to the individual and his or her goal.","content":"An athlete wouldn't follow the same meal plan and exercise routine that a model would follow. Both might be slim but clearly do different things for a living and so have different goals in what to eat and how to exercise.\n\nBeing healthy is strongly tied in to the lifestyle choices we make or don't make everyday. It's like religion. Your beliefs and ideas on what is healthy to you is as differet as your friend, neighbour or sister.\n\nIf you would like to know how to make simple lifestyle changes that are easy to implement, fill in the form below.

Or you already know what you want but can't seem to make it happen. You might be perfectly happy as you are but have a nagging feeling that you could push for a just a little more in life.\n\nWhatever your goal is, I can help you get there. You want to change a certain aspect of your life. You're not quite sure how. All you know is you are ready to change and be different. Better. Happier. You've made a great start.

Yet the hundreds of people I help to achieve their health and wellbeing goals are absolutely way more inspiring.\n\nI started my professional life in corporate communications and have more than 15 years experience managing clients for media agencies providing PR services, strategic counsel and digital marketing services.\n\nI switched from coaching clients on managing their repuation to working with people on their personal development journeys. Using a broad holistic approach, I have over 10 years experience of helping people of all ages, ranging from primary school children to pensioners, in effecting changes in their lives according to their goals.\n\nI push those who want to “up their game” and steadily help those low in confidence to help them make the small changes that lead to more empowered living. My approach is collaborative, motivational and totally congruent with the individual and their personal needs.\n","content":"Then I qualified 10 years ago as a life coach and have since worked with a range of people to make changes in their lives that they didn't think was possible. We all need a cheerleader, a person we can rely on to push us to be our better selves. Usain Bolt is not the world champion he is without the team of coaches around him who bring out the best in him.\n\nWe live in times when stress and mental illness is rife. We have the best medicine the human race has ever known and food in abundance  yet so many are suffering with ill physical and mental health. The information available on what to eat and exercise is confusing and at times misleading.\n\nI take a simple, bespoke approach with each client to help achieve their unique health goal. As well as a life coach, I am a master personal trainer with qualifications in exercise referral, lower back pain, pre/post-natal exercise, COPD and diabetes and obesity management. My knowledge on nutrition means you won't get a faddy diet to follow - just simple, tailored guidance on what is best for YOU to eat.\n\nYou're on this page because you are ready to change. You've thought about it long and hard and now you are ready to do something about it and want someone who knows what the heck they are doing to help you do it. So let's do it!","layout":"page"}]
