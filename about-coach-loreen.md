Yet the hundreds of people I help to achieve their health and wellbeing goals are absolutely way more inspiring.\n\nI started my professional life in corporate communications and have more than 15 years experience managing clients for media agencies providing PR services, strategic counsel and digital marketing services.\n\nI switched from coaching clients on managing their repuation to working with people on their personal development journeys. Using a broad holistic approach, I have over 10 years experience of helping people of all ages, ranging from primary school children to pensioners, in effecting changes in their lives according to their goals.\n\nI push those who want to “up their game” and steadily help those low in confidence to help them make the small changes that lead to more empowered living. My approach is collaborative, motivational and totally congruent with the individual and their personal needs.\n"
