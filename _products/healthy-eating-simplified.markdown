There is so much misinformation and fads where food and drink is concerned. Calorie counting is misunderstood and causes of obesity tend to be too simplistically characterised. I am trained in nutrition and hold a level 4 in Exercise for Obesity and Diabetes. Good nutrition and physical activity is personal to the individual and his or her goal. An athlete wouldn't follow the same meal plan and exercise routine that a model would follow. Both might be slim but clearly do different things for a living and so have different goals in what to eat and how to exercise.

Take a look at the range of articles in this section for a better understanding of nutrition and get in touch for tailored plans to help manage diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and a range of other health conditions that better eating and exercise can help you manage.
