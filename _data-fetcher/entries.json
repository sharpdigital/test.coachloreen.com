Their birth re-awakened a long-held interest in me in how the body works. I couldn’t help wondering how milk alone could sustain a life and was fascinated with the changing nutritional needs of a human body as it evolves from a baby into a little person. I also had no real interest in going back into the corporate world as a corporate communications consultant so I decided to follow my passion and learn about all things wellness and offer my services as a health coach.\n\nMy journey has been one of never-ending learning, so much so that I have taken the cautious approach of not jumping on the blogging bandwagon and regurgitating articles from the internet on things I had no actual scientific training in (like a lot of the people who seemed to write on the topic!)\n\nGreen smoothie anyone? Eat kale or die!!\nSo you can imagine how smug I was feeling when I came across article after article this week where the whole ‘clean eating’ phenomenon appeared to be experiencing a derailment. I watched the BBC’s Horizon programme earlier this week where Dr Giles Yeo examined the origins of this approach to wellness and how the claims made by its core ambassadors (the Deliciously Ellas and Helmsley sisters of this world, to name a few) stacked up. For you see, I had always felt that the whole ‘clean eating’ movement was a bit of a fad and not only that, it was blithely confusing people who were desperate for information on how to improve their lives.\n\nHashtag ‘clean’\nInitially I, like millions of people, thought the philosophy of eating ‘clean’ made sense. If, like me, you experience excruciating abdominal pain soon after eating breakfast cereal (sugared wheat/corn swimming in cow’s milk), it made sense to remove dairy, wheat and sugar from your diet. It also makes lots of sense to eat food freshly prepared, using real fruit and vegetables as opposed to a ready meal packed full of ingredients that didn’t come off a tree or out of the ground but instead was made in a food lab. It spurred me into learning more about things like trans fats, MSG, artificial sweeteners and so on the list goes on things to avoid if you didn’t want to drop down dead instantly from not eating ‘clean’!\n\nPersonally, any chance to learn new things, I’m one excited bunny and all over it. I loved learning all this new stuff but guess what happened? The more I learned, the more confused I became. I remember reading books by two different ‘experts’, both of them with medical qualifications, about nutrition, both with evidence to back up their body of research and both with very reasoned and logical conclusions. Only problem was they totally contradicted each other! From that moment on, I decided the best approach is to take everything with a pinch of salt and never accept one view.\n\nBecause this is what has come to pass in literally just the last couple of years: the public health guidance on only eating low fat to maintain a good weight turned out to be a load of total BS. Low fat in fact turns out makes you more likely to gain weight due to all the sugar added in to food that had all the fat removed to make it taste half decent. Having told us for years to avoid fat like the plague, the so called health experts were now telling us sheepishly that this wasn’t actually correct.\n\nRemember the whole hype about kale, yes that so-called superfood you had to make sure you ate or wouldn’t have that ‘alkaline’ body and would therefore get sick? This was a major PR campaign by the creators of this crop to basically sell more of it. Kale is no more a superfood than any other green vegetable. What they all have in common is the high levels of anti-oxidants which we all know is great for the body. So it didn’t need to be kale. Could have been lettuce, spring greens, spinach etc.\n\nSugar is your enemy! Sugar is satan! Sugar is poison. This is the new mass believe being pushed that I fully cannot abide. I have an upcoming post on the sugar backlash so I won’t go into it now. Point being, we were encouraged to eat a diet high in sugar for years and now we’re being told it’s the cause of everything that’s wrong with our health. OK then\nYou get the idea. Today’s biggest health movement can become next year’s biggest thing that makes everyone peep out of their hands and squirm and deny that they followed such a foolish notion. This is exactly what appears to be happening with clean eating this week. The very doyennes of the movement are fully distancing themselves of it. Oh no! We didn’t say you should do blah… We were just sharing what worked for us. Yah. And so those of us who were fully jealous of all the money and fame they were enjoying, from their many posts as ‘experts’ on better health, clap our hands in glee and indulge in a little schadenfreude.\n\nI’m not being too smug mind you. The logic behind the fad was fairly sound but over time has been shown to affect people in quite negative ways. Some claim it fuelled their anorexia, some claimed it messed them up as these blogs just made them feel even worse about themselves. I personally identified with the philosophy because of my own intolerances to certain foods. \n\nBut I’m not one for moving with the crowd. I also believe you should seek alternative views to every view you come across and keep an open mind. Then you are not a slave to one way of thinking. Saving yourself much embarrassment when there is a sea change of public opinion as the masses take up a new cause celebre. Anyway, happy eating!

We say no when, aged 4, they ask to help cook dinner, because it’s not safe! We keep the TV off so as not to ruin their brain development. We tell them what they must eat to keep them healthy and insist they put more layers on when we feel it’s too cold outside for what they have chosen to wear. But is any of this bad? Or is it exactly your duty as mummy/daddy?\nI spent the first decade of my life being raised by a veritable whole village. I had no mum/dad but many I could count on as a parent. \n\nCollectively, this village taught me to be independent, entrepreneurial, loving, resilient, fun loving and brave. The second decade of my life was spent with the woman who gave birth to me. Her approach to parenting definitely fell into the micro-managed category. Every aspect of my life was so accounted for that I actually had a timetable of what I was supposed to be doing from the moment I woke up right up until the minute I went to bed.\nI left home at 18 as I couldn’t tolerate the tyranny any longer. I look back on my college years as a time of chaos, fog and being almost goalless. My closest friends had parents who gave them a certain level of freedom and autonomy, underpinned by firm guidance on planning for their future. These friends, rather than abusing the freedom given to them by their parents, led balanced lives where they would party hard, after studying hard and putting in a shift in their weekend jobs. This observation imprinted in my mind solidly.\n\nOver the years, it’s been fascinating watching my friends and acquaintances in their approach to managing the whole parenting job. Remember there is no real definitive manual on this one crucial but unpaid job. Sure there are loads of parenting books but none of them can fully prepare you for the delightfully uniqueness of every child born.\n\nAs a former micromanaged child myself, I can speak with authority when I say this kind of child has little to no confidence as they’ve been conditioned to believe they can’t do anything without approval. They can find it hard to regulate their emotions and can lack resilience as they haven’t had a chance to develop this, due to an over-reliance on mum/dad for so much in their formative years. They struggle to make judgement calls as mummy or daddy always thinks for them. Others will rage against this constant control and play up massively when their ‘ruler’ isn’t around.\n\nIt can be a horribly destructive way to bring up a child and often demonstrates a need for that parent to deal with their own childhood issues relating to control. I recognised this when my kids were born as I slowly seemed to morph into that style of parenting I had hated myself. I couldn’t help it. I’m all about self-control and projecting composure. Then I learned from watching the kids who I so wanted my kids to be just like. Their carer didn’t follow them around the room like I did with mine. They didn’t constantly tell them, ‘stop’, ‘no’, ‘don’t’. They often sat chilling while they kept a watchful, calm eye on their charge, allowing them a degree of autonomy to explore their environment.\n\nSlowly I learned. To stand calm but watchful when my super adventurous daughter, aged 2 decided to climb up the rope climbing frame that mostly kids 8years old and upwards were playing on. To let my son figure out for himself why the particular brick he was trying to attach to another wouldn’t click into place. To allow my kids to select what they wanted to wear, which cereal to eat (within a discrete range) and to express an opinion in a way that didn’t hurt another person (as a kid I was definitely not allowed an opinion!).\n\nIt’s funny, but just like the strength of the butterfly’s wing develops by pushing itself out of the cocoon, so do we develop into grounded, strong and well-adjusted humans by being allowed room to grow on our own. Keeping your kid safe doesn’t mean you don’t let them fall ever. Just because you’ve been alive longer doesn’t mean you don’t let them work things out for themselves. And just because you think those green leggings don’t go with the pretty purple organza dress doesn’t mean little Liza can’t wear it to the party. It’s her choice.\n\nYou may recognise the micromanaged child — they’ll be the snowflake in the bunch with the parent that follows them around the room.

Since then I have been looking at alternative remedies and ways of reversing my symptoms. After all, I wasn’t born with this!\n\nFirst I looked at why some of us are afflicted with this allergy while others just blithely go through every summer without one sneeze or itch.\n\nOur body’s symptomatic reaction as hay fever occurs when the immune system mistakes airborne substances such as dust, pollen and pollution as a threat.  Our body then produces an antibody called immunoglobulin E to attack what it thinks are harmful substances trying to come inside it. It then releases the chemical histamine which causes the itching, runny nose and watery eyes etc. This is the body’s way of trying to get rid of what it thinks are toxins.\nThere are seasonal hay fever triggers which include pollen and spores that will cause symptoms during certain months of the year as follows:\n\n* Tree pollen tends to affect people between March and June\n* Grass pollen tends to affect people between May and September\n* Weed pollen tends to affect people in the autumn (fall)\n\nAdditionally, those of us living in the city, especially fairly green and leafy cities such as London, can suffer worse than those in the country as the heat and fumes from cars can trap pollen in the atmosphere.  Combine the presence of numerous high rise buildings and warm, dry, airless weather and you get a situation where these pesky pollen have no way of dispersing into the atmosphere as they normally would so they fall down on us instead!\n\nThis year, as the summer has been so late in coming in the UK, experts say there is an even greater buildup of pollen in the atmosphere and predict this summer to be the worst for hayfever in the last 50 years.\n\nNaturopaths and nutritionists believe that one of the main reasons a quarter of the population suffers from this allergy is due to a weak immune system, directly linked to excess toxins in the digestive system.\n\nSo what can you do about all this? Well for a start you can take note of foods you eat that are high in histamine. It makes sense to steer clear of these foods especially during the allergy season so that you don’t add to the histamine your body will try and produce in response to pollen attacking it.\n\n\nBelow is a list of some of the common foods that are high in histamine:\n\n* Pickled, tinned, canned, preserved foods\n* Cheese: especially matured and hard cheese – the more matured the more histamine\n* Tomatoes\n* Smoked, cured meat, cured ham, salami\n* Most fish products (all shell fish), especially preserved fish products\n* Beans and pulses/legumes (especially chickpeas and soy beans, also peanuts)\n* Soy products (soy milk, soy cream, tofu, soy sauce)\n* Wheat products (bread, cakes, biscuits etc)\n* Pickles\n* Ready meals\n* Some fruit varieties (banana, pears, aubergines, oranges, kiwi, strawberries)\n* Alcohol, especially wine and beer\n* Yeast\n* Black tea\n* Chocolate, cocoa\n* Sweets with preservatives and/or food colourings\n* Malt vinegar\n* Nuts\n\n\nSo now we know what causes the symptoms and what foods to avoid, what are the best remedies (aside from anti-histamine tablets)?  From low-histamine foods, helpful vitamins and homeopathic remedies, it can be a lengthy (not to mention expensive) process of finding what works best for you. Below are some of the treatments some people swear by:\n\nEating low-histamine food such as:\n\n* Vitamin C-rich foods such as kiwi, citrus and papaya\n* Dark green, leafy vegetables\n* Deep yellow and orange vegetables\n* Nettles, bamboo shoots, cabbage, beets, carrots, yams\n* Onions, garlic, ginger, cayenne, horseradish, licorice\n* Pineapple\n* Turmeric\n* Probiotics\n* Camomile, butterbur and peppermint\n* Fresh fish, meat and poultry. The older the produce, the more histamine builds up in it!\n\n\nTaking immune-boosting supplements, vitamins and minerals such as:\n\n* Bioflavonoids (e.g., quercetin, catechin, and hesperidin)\n* Flaxseed oil\n* Probiotics (e.g. lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidus).  Probiotics are bowel microflora organisms—microscopic bacteria that normally inhabit the intestines.\n* Omega 3, 6, 9\n* Vitamin A\n* Vitamin C\n* Vitamin E\n* Zinc\n\n\nDirect treatments that work for some people:\n\n* Petroleum jelly on the eye lashes and nostrils\n* Eye baths. I like to dampen a piece of cotton wool after I wash my face and gently wipe my eyelids with it. It can clear a lot more of the tiny pollen that gets trapped in the skin and causes itching than just washing your eyes alone\n* Nasal drops\n* Damp cotton wool in the outer canal of the ear to stop pollen getting in the inner canal and causing itching\n* Red nasal light\n* Local honey\n* Acupuncture\n* Salt pipe therapy\n* HEPA air filters for the car and indoors. These can clean pollen and other allergens in the air inside the home or car. A Humidifier would similarly be helpful as it sprays cold steam into the air in your home and effectively cleans the tiny particles floating around.\n\n\nEssentially, months before the hayfever season begins you have to start a detox by eliminating foods that are high in histamines. Ideally you should do a colon cleanse too to ensure your bowel function and immune system is in good order. You then need to dose up on foods and minerals that help to break down histamines in the body so that when all that pollen starts flying around your body can handle it.\n\nFunny enough as my main trigger is grass pollen, on the days I manage to cut out wheat (i.e. no pasta, bread, cakes, biscuits etc), my symptoms aren’t too bad. Keeping dairy and sugar to a minimum also keeps me free of a congested head and nasal passage. This is because wheat, sugar and dairy all cause mucus to build up in our system.","relatedCategories":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3inxc2wsnyz3"}},"id":"3EfPO0Kk1WQIM4oYIgIyCa","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-07-02T17:48:15.840Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-02T17:48:15.840Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-GB"},"fields":{"name":"Healthy Body","slug":"healthy-body"}}]}},"7vh5nu8erKmoo20Mg2wAWe":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3inxc2wsnyz3"}},"id":"7vh5nu8erKmoo20Mg2wAWe","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-06-24T13:34:08.457Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-18T11:19:08.087Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"blogArticles"}},"locale":"en-GB"},"fields":{"articleTitle":"Am I a better adult because my parents micro-managed me as a kid?","slug":"am-i-a-better-adult-because-my-parents-micro-managed-me-as-a-kid","publishDate":"2016-03-16T00:00+01:00","intro":"\nAs parents, our over riding instinct is to keep our little creation safe.

For some people it’s the best excuse never to do it.\nIt is generally recommended that adults aged 18–64 should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/factsheet_adults/en/\nThe key to this is chunking manageable minutes of meaningful physical activity throughout each day. It also helps to know what ‘meaningful physical activity’ is. Think of anything you do that makes you breathless (and not because you are suffering from asthma or a similar condition!), e.g. heavy gardening, housework, steady paced walking, cycling, working out, or even using the stairs instead of the elevator.\nKeep reading for more ways you can get breathless, especially if you are the one doing the school run:\nLiven your morning up with a 4 minute tabata:\nThis is the Japanese approach to high intensity interval work outs that literally takes 4 minutes to complete. Pick one or two exercises such as jumping jacks, high knees, jumping squats or jogging on the spot. Do the exercise at the fastest pace you can manage for 20 seconds then rest for 10 seconds. You do this a total of 8 rounds without stopping which adds up to 4 minutes. If you are totally deconditioned, start with 4 rounds which will only take 2 minutes. This approach to exercise has been proven by doctors and scientists to get you fitter than hours and hours in the gym. As you get fitter, you can do multiple rounds of 4 minutes. There are also various apps in your app store which can do the timing for you. I like to use Hardfox Tabata.\n2. If you consider yourself ‘hard’, try some press ups just before you get in the bath\nPlace your hands on the edge of your bath, ensure your back is straight and your hips are in line with your shoulder. Your body will be tilted at an angle as you aim to lower your whole body towards the bath, focussing on your upper body taking up the majority of your weight. Hold your stomach in and see how many you can do. Try to double that amount by the end of the week.\n3. While waiting at the school gates, practice your pelvic floor exercises.\nOur pelvic floor muscle is essential to our core strenght. Our core muscle is instrumental in our ability to balance and do so much more than you realise. This muscle weakens as we get older and for those of us who have had babies, we are more at risk of having a weak or damaged pelvic floor. To keep the pelvic floor tight, simply squeeze and hold yourself in as if you are desperate to pee but holding it in. Do this for a count of 10 several times. There is an aid called a Kegel that women can use to facilitate this too. The beauty of this is no one can see you doing this exercise! You can do it as you stand, while you are driving, while you walk through the aisles of the supermarket picking up your groceries, while you’re cooking, doing homework with the kids…. You get the idea. Men can do this exercise too as we are all at risk of incontinence as we reach old age.\n4. Multi tasking fitness with kitchen duties\nHow many squats or push ups can you do while the milk is warming up or while the bread is toasting? Do 5 more the next day! This is a challenge you can easily set yourself. Do it to any chore you care to.\n5. Squeeze 5 minutes of a workout in while your little one is getting dressed\nHow many star jumps can you squeeze in while you are waiting for the little darlings to finish their breakfast, finish getting dressed or find their school bag? You know that last 10 minutes that you seem to be waiting interminably for your little loves to be ready so you can leave the house — this is a great opportunity to up your active minutes for the day.\n6. How many times can you go up and down the stairs while you are brushing your teeth?\nA lady I worked with once said she lost tens of kilos by simply going up and down her stairs every day. She would do it while she was brushing her teeth, while she was getting dressed and also find pockets of time in the day to challenge herself. She started with 5 flights and gradually increased the amount every day until she was doing 100 flights at a time! If there are no stairs where you live, do some squats while you are brushing your teeth. Every day you can challenge yourself to do 2 more than you did the day before.\n7. After dropping the darlings to school, lunge back home if you’re only around the corner (or lunge to the station if you’re heading on to work)\nOk so I appreciate that this suggestion is a tad way out, but give it a go — you may just love it. Don’t worry about folks looking at you like you need therapy. They’re just jealous they didn’t think of it :).\n\nYour little darlings might even get involved too!\n8. Jog on the spot outside the kids bedroom to encourage them to wake up\nThe alarm has gone off. You have yelled more times than you care to count. And still they won’t stir. The clock is ticking and you want to avoid the daily last minute rushing that goes on due to your little darlings not getting up when you called them. A friend of mine says she stopped using her loud hailer after several complaints from the neighbours and her own rising stress levels. Instead, she steals some exercise time by jogging on the spot as fast as she can. This makes enough of an irritating noise to wake up her brood within about two minutes AND she gets to burn off a few calories. WIN-WIN.\n9. Skip while the children are doing their homework\nGranted this one may prove difficult if you have toddlers that need your support while they do their school work. Aim for 1-minute sprints of skipping throughout the whole time the children are doing their home work. Then set yourself a target of 5–10 sprints to ensure you raise your heart rate enough to get you breathless.\n10.

Their birth re-awakened a long-held interest in me in how the body works. I couldn’t help wondering how milk alone could sustain a life and was fascinated with the changing nutritional needs of a human body as it evolves from a baby into a little person. I also had no real interest in going back into the corporate world as a corporate communications consultant so I decided to follow my passion and learn about all things wellness and offer my services as a health coach.\n\nMy journey has been one of never-ending learning, so much so that I have taken the cautious approach of not jumping on the blogging bandwagon and regurgitating articles from the internet on things I had no actual scientific training in (like a lot of the people who seemed to write on the topic!)\n\nGreen smoothie anyone? Eat kale or die!!\nSo you can imagine how smug I was feeling when I came across article after article this week where the whole ‘clean eating’ phenomenon appeared to be experiencing a derailment. I watched the BBC’s Horizon programme earlier this week where Dr Giles Yeo examined the origins of this approach to wellness and how the claims made by its core ambassadors (the Deliciously Ellas and Helmsley sisters of this world, to name a few) stacked up. For you see, I had always felt that the whole ‘clean eating’ movement was a bit of a fad and not only that, it was blithely confusing people who were desperate for information on how to improve their lives.\n\nHashtag ‘clean’\nInitially I, like millions of people, thought the philosophy of eating ‘clean’ made sense. If, like me, you experience excruciating abdominal pain soon after eating breakfast cereal (sugared wheat/corn swimming in cow’s milk), it made sense to remove dairy, wheat and sugar from your diet. It also makes lots of sense to eat food freshly prepared, using real fruit and vegetables as opposed to a ready meal packed full of ingredients that didn’t come off a tree or out of the ground but instead was made in a food lab. It spurred me into learning more about things like trans fats, MSG, artificial sweeteners and so on the list goes on things to avoid if you didn’t want to drop down dead instantly from not eating ‘clean’!\n\nPersonally, any chance to learn new things, I’m one excited bunny and all over it. I loved learning all this new stuff but guess what happened? The more I learned, the more confused I became. I remember reading books by two different ‘experts’, both of them with medical qualifications, about nutrition, both with evidence to back up their body of research and both with very reasoned and logical conclusions. Only problem was they totally contradicted each other! From that moment on, I decided the best approach is to take everything with a pinch of salt and never accept one view.\n\nBecause this is what has come to pass in literally just the last couple of years: the public health guidance on only eating low fat to maintain a good weight turned out to be a load of total BS. Low fat in fact turns out makes you more likely to gain weight due to all the sugar added in to food that had all the fat removed to make it taste half decent. Having told us for years to avoid fat like the plague, the so called health experts were now telling us sheepishly that this wasn’t actually correct.\n\nRemember the whole hype about kale, yes that so-called superfood you had to make sure you ate or wouldn’t have that ‘alkaline’ body and would therefore get sick? This was a major PR campaign by the creators of this crop to basically sell more of it. Kale is no more a superfood than any other green vegetable. What they all have in common is the high levels of anti-oxidants which we all know is great for the body. So it didn’t need to be kale. Could have been lettuce, spring greens, spinach etc.\n\nSugar is your enemy! Sugar is satan! Sugar is poison. This is the new mass believe being pushed that I fully cannot abide. I have an upcoming post on the sugar backlash so I won’t go into it now. Point being, we were encouraged to eat a diet high in sugar for years and now we’re being told it’s the cause of everything that’s wrong with our health. OK then\nYou get the idea. Today’s biggest health movement can become next year’s biggest thing that makes everyone peep out of their hands and squirm and deny that they followed such a foolish notion. This is exactly what appears to be happening with clean eating this week. The very doyennes of the movement are fully distancing themselves of it. Oh no! We didn’t say you should do blah… We were just sharing what worked for us. Yah. And so those of us who were fully jealous of all the money and fame they were enjoying, from their many posts as ‘experts’ on better health, clap our hands in glee and indulge in a little schadenfreude.\n\nI’m not being too smug mind you. The logic behind the fad was fairly sound but over time has been shown to affect people in quite negative ways. Some claim it fuelled their anorexia, some claimed it messed them up as these blogs just made them feel even worse about themselves. I personally identified with the philosophy because of my own intolerances to certain foods. \n\nBut I’m not one for moving with the crowd. I also believe you should seek alternative views to every view you come across and keep an open mind. Then you are not a slave to one way of thinking. Saving yourself much embarrassment when there is a sea change of public opinion as the masses take up a new cause celebre. Anyway, happy eating!

So much so that she drank all the water I left on her bedside table (a rarity in itself as she’s not a huge fan of the stuff) then wet the bed. Again, that was very peculiar for her. Anyway I gave her some painkiller, changed the sheets and put her back to bed thinking everything will be fine in the morning. A very unsettled night, however, foretold what was to come. She was far from well the next day and I duly took her to the doctors as she was complaining of a headache, earache, sore throat and was far from her usual bubbly self. I also knew there was a lot of bugs going round the school so I just wanted to check if she had an actual infection.\nThe visit to the doctor proved fruitless. No infection was detected in her ear or throat so we were sent home with the info that perhaps a virus was ‘brewing’. Interesting. By Saturday, the cycle of super high temperature, headache and chills (despite administering plenty of fluids and painkiller) was worrying. So finally I called 111, the UK’s NHS Direct service, where a very helpful triage assistant asked me a load of questions after which she advised me to take my daughter straight to the hospital and present at the Urgent Care Centre unit. Once upon a time, the call handler would have dispatched an ambulance to your home to deal with this emergency, yet nowadays so much time and resources are saved by going through this preliminary process and encouraging you to take yourself to one of several medical centres near your home.\nThe Urgent Care Centre at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Greenwich is adjacent to it’s Accident & Emergency section. Confusingly, the helpful lady on the phone had told me to go straight to the UCC but we were then redirected back to A&E to check in before coming back to the UCC to wait to be seen by a doctor. Several people came in like we did then had to be redirected to get booked in. Other than this, the whole system was fairly seamless and our visit lasted less than two hours. After checking in, a triage nurse asked me some of the same questions I had already answered on the phone.\nWe then waited for the doctor to call us; who asked the same questions again and checked her out (same as the triage nurse had done less than 45 minutes previously). Other than a slightly swollen gland on one side of her jaw, nothing major was evident and the doctor helped us obtain our prescription through — wait for it — a vending machine! OK so for some of you this isn’t new. I am aware these machines were trialled some years back and as I generally avoid the emergency services unless absolutely necessary, I had NO idea our hospitals were using these futuristic medical marvels. He simply touched some icons on the touch screen interface and out popped our antibiotics. I almost felt like the classic JJC (Johnny Just Come) as I watched this all unfold. I remembered the stories my parents would tell of newcomers (from Africa) to Western cities who would be so amazed by things they had never seen before, such as escalators, that they would proclaim it was witchcraft! In some cases, point blank refusing to use things like escalators or revolving doors for fear of being harmed by some unseen entity. Some of the funniest stories I heard my folks tell were of such occurrences. And right then as the prescription was dispensed without the need for a pharmacy, I felt just like the proverbial JJC."}},"C5oHzkeySOq0OsokcGs0K":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3inxc2wsnyz3"}},"id":"C5oHzkeySOq0OsokcGs0K","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-06-24T13:34:45.731Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-18T11:01:32.062Z","revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"blogArticles"}},"locale":"en-GB"},"fields":{"articleTitle":"What is your mind fuel for sailing through life?","slug":"mind-fuel-for-sailing-through-life","publishDate":"2014-02-25T00:00+01:00","intro":"Life’s journey is an amazing treasure.

How they got into keeping fit, why, who and what motivates them etc.\n\nWhat I managed to get was a collection of truly fantastic stories from ten fabulous women who represent a range of all you women out there, whether you are a mum or not.  Each one has a different reason for keeping fit and a totally different approach to how they achieve this.  This was the story for me. The fact that you can have the same goal but have different reasons for having that goal and therefore take a totally different approach to the next person.  Different journeys to the same destination, but you all get there in your own way.  \n\nThank you so much to the ladies who contributed to this.

When I had my first child, I wasn’t too bothered about losing the extra half a stone I had put on as I was probably too skinny before and I also knew I wanted to have another child so there was no point in getting a six pack just to undo all that effort and have a big tummy again!\n\nAfter I had my second child, I seemed to have put on more weight than previously and the weight just didn’t seem to come off as easy as it did with my first child. Finally I had empathy for what my friends and magazine covers were talking about.\n\n I knew was done in the baby-making department and was determined to shift the extra weight and get back into my skinny jeans but it didn’t happen for a while and it became a frustrating process.\n\n \n\nSara with her niece\nSara with her niece\nHospitality is a huge part of the Arab culture and when a woman gives birth, the custom is for her to have 40 days rest to recover from the trauma of childbirth. During this period, the family would get an extended round of visits from family and friends who would bring food, come and help with any chores and give any emotional help and support needed. \n\nA huge part of these visits involves eating the food that the visitors have brought (while they are still with you!) to show gratitude for their time and effort. As you can imagine, this means piling on a whole load of weight in the first couple of months of giving birth. I was having two breakfasts and two dinners at one stage!\n\n After the 40 days, there then tends to be a lot of invites to family type events with the idea being to get the mother and child back out and socialising which can also help prevent post-natal depression. I often just put on a nice pretty kaftan, convincing myself I was being a good Arab wife and mum when really it was just a way to hide the extra pounds and not bother do anything about it for as long as I could hide it under a swathe of fabric.\n\n \n\nIMG_2762\n\nWhen my son was a few years old, I decided to separate from my husband and I moved with the children to leafy Chiswick. This was life-changing in many ways. It was amazing watching people running by the river, looking like they were in a completely serene zone.\n\nI was also inspired by the many mums I saw running with their prams and thought, wow, I have no excuse not to get fit. Having watched my mum suffer years of ill health from not taking care of her wellbeing (using the fact that she’d had five kids as her reason to be overweight), and not liking the feeling of discomfort when I put my clothes on, I joined the riverside jogging herd and also joined a gym.\n\n \n\nAbs in the making...\nAbs in the making…\nI would go 3-4 times a week, spending an hour and half in the gym by splitting my time between cardio, light weights and stretching. As much as I enjoyed jogging by the river, I preferred using the cardio machines more with the simple reason being that I wanted to be able to track my progress. I needed to see numbers, how fast I’m going, how much I’m burning etc. I loved working out alone and found the time by myself a great way to relax and refocus.  Being a single mum and self-employed can be stressful and you can totally forget to make time for yourself.\n\nI also reduced my sugar intake and cut out a lot of the processed starches that is prevalent in my culture. It meant also cutting down how much coffee I drank which was hard as I love my caffeine.\n\n \n\n \n\nOne of the amazing mums I met, who is now a good friend, is a personal trainer and a shining example of holistic wellness.  She would take me to health food shops and introduce me to weird and wonderful things I’d never heard of or ever thought I would be eating. She truly motivates me to stay healthy as she is mum of three, runs her own business and still takes good care of herself.\n\n  \n\n \n\nAngela Cozier, 39, Nutritional adviser and mother to 15 year old daughter.\n\n \n\nAngela Cozier\nAngela Cozier\nI started working out 17 years ago mainly to keep healthy. After the birth of my daughter, the training aim then became one of weight loss to regain my figure. Although I trained regularly, going to aerobics classes etc, it’s not until almost four years ago when I did Shaun T’s Insanity that I finally lost most of my excess body weight. My husband has also suffered with colitis for many years and, along with our new keep-fit regime, I started the whole family on a clean eating programme.\n\nFor many years I was a Business Systems Analyst but felt like I needed a change. My journey in becoming fit and healthier through fitness and clean eating compelled me to share my new found knowledge with the world. I completed a diploma in Nutritional Therapy in 2013 and set up my own business as a Nutritional Adviser shortly after in the same year.\n\nI tend to train six days a week, especially if I’m following a programme (Insanity, P90x Chalean Extreme etc) and when I train al fresco, I do a mix of high intensity interval training, weights and stretching. I train fasted to allow for maximum fat burn and break my fast with a spread consisting of a large portion of protein and fresh vegetables.\n\nMy motivation for training is simply to stay healthy, especially to be healthy and be there for my family. It’s also so I can motivate others by being an example of the life I preach.\n\nAngela on holiday in 2012\nAngela on holiday in 2012\nI love training my legs as I can lift heavier weights during squats/lunges but I really don’t like working on my abs.

My husband bought me the membership as a Christmas gift as he knew I wanted to get fitter. I have always been slim and weighed around 48-50 kilos but when I had my twin boys 7 years ago, my weight shot up to 70 kilos!\n\nI managed to shed the excess 20 kilos I had gained just four months after having my boys by simply exercised in the house. Not with a fitness DVD or anything boring like that!  I would walk up and down the stairs several times. I started off with going up and down around 20 times, gradually increasing the number to 50, then 100 times. While sitting down watching TV, I would be doing leg raises and triceps dips as I found TV a total waste of time. I also love dancing, especially salsa and would try and go whenever possible.\n\nLuckily, I am also not a big fan of sugar and I have always eaten very healthily. I cook everything from scratch and rarely do ready meals.\n\nI am enjoying going to the gym now as I have used a personal trainer who has shown me how to get the most out of my sessions in the gym.  I love working on my legs but don’t like press ups or floor work.\n\n My husband is my inspiration. Rain, snow or sunshine, he goes out jogging. He didn’t  put any pressure on me to lose the baby weight but seeing him so dedicated to his fitness motivated me to also get fit.

After the birth of my second child, I needed an outlet and to do an activity for me.  I used to do Judo as a child and thought about doing it again but wanted to do something more athletic and involving kicking, probably because I liked watching martial arts films so much!  I took up Tang Soo Do as a new years resolution after being introduced to it by a friend and haven’t looked back since. I was never interested in going to the gym or aerobic type classes so this was a perfect alternative to spending hours each week in a gym or group class.\n\nI train 3-4 times a week, increasing it to 6-9 times a week when I’m preparing for an event such as tournament etc. My training includes swimming, running and martial arts. My favourite part of training is working on my legs and stomach as these are my strongest points.\n\nExercise is a huge part of my life. When I’m not able to train it really affects my mood. The only time I am happy not to train is when I go on holiday, although I love swimming on holiday too.\n\nMaster Duane Maynard, one of my Tang Soo Do instructors is a true inspiration.  He’s a machine! I admire his determination and huge achievements as a martial arts professional. My training partner Deanne is also an inspiration with her steely determination and stubbornness for achieving her goals. I am also surrounded by friends with amazing discipline and focus on getting the results they want in every area of their lives. This motivates to keep doing my best too. \n\nI have a naturally high metabolism and eat pretty much what I like. Having said that, I do eat a very balanced diet.

I didn’t really keep it up but a few years later I joined the local leisure centre and really loved step and aerobic classes. I have been keeping fit ever since and went on to qualify as a personal trainer.\n\n \n\n \n\nTM2I like to train around 3-4 times a week using Pilates and floor-based workouts. I prefer this to the high intensity interval training programmes as I haven’t found them to really work for me.  I love working on my lower body but I’m not keen on core work. I really admire Davina Mcall for her work in promoting fitness.

I love seeing the results of my hard work, constantly challenge myself and enjoy doing bootcamps, salsa and boxing along with working out in the gym. My favourite exercise is abs and floor work with weights. I’m not so keen on using the bike and spin classes! My constant motivation is the desire never to be a size 16-18 ever again.\n\nMy favourite part of my body is my legs as so many people tell me it looks amazing, which always makes me feel good.

I like working on my legs, bums and arms as those are the body parts I would like to change the most.\n\n I’m not a major fitness fanatic.

I am currently following a number of fitness instructors on Facebook and my main reason for this is to become more knowledgeable in helping me get closer to my own long term fitness goal.  However from a karate perspective, I would have to say Gichin Funakoshi, “the father of karate” is a real inspiration.  Master Funakoshi’s struggle to refine and popularise the art of karate is a fine example of persevering and striving for what you believe in.\n\nI think I have a very balanced diet. I tend to have six small meals a day, consisting of protein, carbs and good fats. I also mainly drink water and herbal teas, rather than juices or fizzy drinks.\n\nML2\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRosemary Patten\nRosemary Patten\nRosemary Patten, 60+, Holistic business owner, mother to daughter aged 30+ \n\nMy first attempt at keeping fit was when I took up badminton in my 30s and I did it for about 3 years. I loved the game but eventually gave up as I just didn’t have the strength and competitive edge you need to win games. \n\nI then took up yoga and swimming which I liked much more as both are individual activities where the only competition is yourself. I am not a huge fan of aerobic type classes as I don’t really have the co-ordination you seem to need at some of these fast-paced classes and I just feel silly when I can’t keep up. I find swimming quite a peaceful activity, especially when there’s hardly anyone in the pool.\n\n I had to stop going, however as I couldn’t go on a regular basis due to the difficulty in juggling my part time work, being a wife and mother and the unpredictable working hours of my husband’s job.\n\n Around 12 years ago, with my daughter now all grown up and more of my own time to myself, I went back to doing yoga and swimming and have been going regularly since. I go to yoga twice a week and swimming once a week, depending on what client bookings, meetings or other commitments I have that week. I love the standing poses in yoga the best but I’m not a huge fan of core exercises as it’s my weakest area.\n\nRosemary, right, at yoga\nRosemary, right, at yoga\n I truly appreciate the value of exercise, especially as you get older. Diabetes, high blood pressure, impaired cognitive function and certain types of cancers are all more prevalent as you get older. Your body is also not as strong or toned as when you are younger and exercising is a great way to stay healthy, both physically and mentally.\n\nLinda and some of the ladies in my yoga class (who are a few years older than me!) are inspirational in how fit they are for their age. Some of them do weights in the gym as well as yoga and have incredibly fit and strong bodies. They can manage some of the more difficult moves in yoga due to their strength and flexibility. Another inspiration is my close friend who is 70 and has been playing badminton from since our children were really young. Although I stopped, she’s still playing and is as fit and brilliant at it as ever!\n\nGenerally, I don’t eat less than two hours before I exercise, so on the days I am going to work out, I eat my breakfast earlier than normal and then have a small snack after. I don’t eat anything else until my dinner which tends to be freshly prepared meats, fresh vegetables and not too much starches.\n\n \n\nLorenza Attard, 40+, Office Manager and mother to 15 year old boy\n\nLorenza competing for Mrs Malta\nLorenza competing for Mrs Malta\n It’s fair to say staying fit has always been a part of my life. I started dancing when I was 13 and worked as a professional dancer for eight years before stopping after the birth of my son.\n\n I currently train six times a week doing weight training, muay thai and Tang Soo Do. My favourite exercise is leg training but with a current shoulder injury, upper body work is my least favourite.  I follow a high protein, low carb diet and have to eat every two hours because of the sheer amount of energy I burn every day.  Training and dieting go hand in hand, you can’t have one without the other.\n\n Training is my life. I love the full contact aspect and explosive power involved in doing muay thai. I also love the traditional element to Tang Soo Do and the self defence techniques it teaches, especially learning how to use weapons. In the ten years I have been doing Tang Soo Do, the training involved in attaining the senior belts has taken me on some unforgettable journeys.  I am inspired by different people for various reasons. From a martial arts background, I feel Bruce Lee  is a true inspiration.  His agility, knowledge and determination to bring martial arts to the Western world are truly inspiring.   From a fitness point of view Andreia Brazier is someone I aspire to. I admire her dedication, mental strength and focus.\n\nLorenza at a tournament\nLorenza at a tournament\n             \n\nPOST NAVIGATION\n← Mind fuel for sailing through life\nTraining Philosophy with Elliott Charles →"}},"6m1Zg3Xt96WOoyKeswCIkY":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3inxc2wsnyz3"}},"id":"6m1Zg3Xt96WOoyKeswCIkY","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-06-24T13:34:08.433Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-24T13:34:08.433Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"blogArticles"}},"locale":"en-GB"},"fields":{"articleTitle":"In what way do positive views maintain life satisfaction and wellness?","slug":"in-what-way-do-positive-views-maintain-life-satisfaction-and-wellness","intro":"As a wellness practitioner, one of the first things I help clients to explore and define is their outlook. Not just on life but everything they hold dear. Because one of the best lessons I learned myself is that we choose how we feel. How we respond to things that happen to us. How we react to any situation. And yet in order to do this, you need a veritable toolkit you can refer to that will equip you damn well in any situation.\nOne of the biggest reasons The Secret was a phenomenal success was its basic premise that if you focus on your dreams and maintain a positive attitude, those said dreams will come true. Millions of people swore this was an amazing revelation to their lives and numerous others will tell you it didn’t work out so good for them. The response to the, shall we say, ‘failures’ is that they didn’t remove all doubt and negativity from their thoughts.\nWhat I loved about The Secret wasn’t just that the week I started reading it, I managed to visualise and manifest a free cup of chai latte on my morning stop at the coffee shop, but it totally inspired me to have a more positive outlook. (Hey, I’m easily pleased. Some visualised big houses, I was happy with a free latte!)\nOne of the most shared quotes illustrates this simple truth — “If you think you can do a thing or think you can’t do a thing, you’re right.” — Henry Ford. Whatever you choose to believe, that will be your reality.\nYou just need to look at some of the top athletes and most successful people in the world to see this in practice. Each one will tell you that the key to their success isn’t just training but remaining extremely focussed and having a positive mindset. You see, no serious competitor is going to allow the possibility of failure to float in their head. There is no room for doubt. They absolutely must remain focussed on being the winner. This fuels their performance and gives them the much needed confidence to battle through the match/race etc. Especially during moments when they are losing. As a tennis fan, Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic have displayed some of the best examples of unfailing winning mentality I’ve ever seen. I’ve watched both on the losing end of a match and somehow retain their composure and pull a win out the bag — against the run of play. Pure positive mental attitude.\nI have a client who is wheelchair-bound and another who is almost totally blind. I help them exercise in the gym every week and they totally inspire me. Both are very young and don’t let their disability get in the way of having a life lived to the full. In fact they have much better social calendars than a lot of able bodied folk I know! What they both have in common is their attitude to life. Yes, they have days that their situation gets them down. They have to encounter appalling ignorance on many occasions from people who sometimes don’t know how to approach them. But overall, they focus on the many positives in their lives and get on with living a life as full as possible.\nWellness seems to be one of the buzzwords of 2017 but many of us have been practicing this for decades. We are now living in times where health and fitness is entrenched in daily living. Mindfulness is the other buzzword that seeks to teach people the importance of perspective. Then came wellness which seems to be the catch-all term for everything.\nNow, being satisfied with your life and being well are two slightly different things although one can affect the other. Each one of us will have different criteria for being satisfied with life. And each one of us will define our wellness according to different scales. For the person who is chronically ill, a pain-free day/week equals success for them. For someone with no health issues, their wellness might be defined through the satisfaction they feel from drinking a green smoothie daily, exercising and eating ‘clean’.\nJane might be very satisfied with her life because she has a dream job, is living an awesome life dating different guys every week and gets to travel the world. Jo might be equally as satisfied with her life as a housewife and daily routine mapped around her family’s needs. It’s all she ever wanted. Both may encounter challenges in their lives but probably choose to focus on the numerous positives of the dream life they have carved for themselves. On the other hand, you may get two other people with similar lives who feel completely unsatisfied with their lives.\nIt’s a question of perspective and what you choose to focus on. It takes practice, lots of flexibility to modify any long-held views as needed and buckets of resilience."}},"4sPgTQdN56Sg6UaGIyyGaq":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3inxc2wsnyz3"}},"id":"4sPgTQdN56Sg6UaGIyyGaq","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-06-24T13:34:07.679Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-18T10:59:33.251Z","revision":4,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"blogArticles"}},"locale":"en-GB"},"fields":{"articleTitle":"10 Things you need to know about breast cysts","slug":"10-things-you-need-to-know-about-breast-cysts","publishDate":"2014-07-23T00:00+01:00","intro":"The recent discovery of an unusual lumpy mass in my right breast had me running superfast to my doctors who referred me to the hospital for a scan.

Breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs and are common in women aged 35-50 years (although younger women and men can also get them) \n1. Although no specific causes can be cited for definite, hormonal changes in the body are thought to be the most common cause of benign (i.e. non-cancerous) lumps in breasts \n1. Benign breast lumps do not increase your risk of nor develop into breast cancer \n1. Some people with cysts may not feel any symptoms and others may feel symptoms ranging from pain in either breast, sunken nipples, dimpling on the skin of the breast, a rash on or around the nipple or a change in the size of  the breast\n1. The size of the cysts vary from miniscule to several centimetres in diameter. It is also possible to have one or several cysts in one or both breasts\n1. Screening is a simple process involving an ultrasound scan, mammogram and in some cases inspiration of the cyst (where sample tissue is taken and further examined)\n1. It is thought that reducing your intake of caffeine, chocolate and fatty or fried foods can improve the condition.  There are also a lot of studies that link breast cancer to dioxin (an environmental pollutant) and other heavy metals we are exposed to on a daily basis as these pollutants tend to accumulate in fatty tissue. Avoid drinking water and soft drinks sold in plastic bottles and where possible use skincare products that contain no parabens.\n1. Other holistic remedies include increasing intake of vitamin E, evening primrose oil, iodine and vitamin B6 which is particularly good for liver function. An impaired liver function can mean an excess of hormones in the body which can be stored as, for example, cysts in the breast\n1. Therapeutic massages such as the Tibetan breast massage stimulates the endocrine system to balance the female hormones as well as keeping the tissue from getting overly congested\n1. Regularly feel your breasts, either in the shower/bath or during the moisturising part of your beauty regime. This is your best chance at spotting any changes in the shape etc of your breasts. Some changes are a natural part of whatever is going on in your life at that time (pregnancy, monthly cycle, aging etc) and some changes need medical attention. The only way to know for sure is to get it checked out and quickly!\n2. Early diagnosis could be live saving.  More info can be found from the NHS’s website here:  http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Breast-lump/Pages/Introduction.aspx\n\nSince my scan, I stopped drinking cocoa every night, stopped drinking my beloved Earl Grey tea, ate less chicken and used even less oil in my cooking than I already did.  Why? Well the first three items are known to be high in compounds that interfere with hormone levels in the body and too much fat in your diet can put your liver under stress which means it works less effectively.\n\nI also started taking evening primrose oil, a B vitamin complex and Omega oils supplements.  I also did a juice cleanse using different combinations of ginger, beetroot, mint, celery and turmeric along with green leafy vegetables.  Within a few weeks of making these changes, the unusual lump in my breast has completely disappeared!! I can’t believe it either. Clearly I needed to clean out my organs…..","relatedCategories":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3inxc2wsnyz3"}},"id":"6wj0SKlHkQqIi6SmIUekCQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-07-02T17:29:39.986Z","updatedAt":"2017-07-02T17:29:39.986Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"category"}},"locale":"en-GB"},"fields":{"name":"Womens health","slug":"womens-health"}}]}},"6m2FrJqAjmMYaE2oqUASGK":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3inxc2wsnyz3"}},"id":"6m2FrJqAjmMYaE2oqUASGK","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-06-24T13:34:07.615Z","updatedAt":"2017-06-24T13:34:07.615Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"blogArticles"}},"locale":"en-GB"},"fields":{"articleTitle":"Why I don’t bother with new year’s resolutions","slug":"why-i-don-t-bother-with-new-year-s-resolutions","intro":"Why I don’t bother with new year’s resolutions\nThe clock counted down, we all hugged, raised our glasses and wished each other a happy new year. Another year dawns and signals the clamour of self flagellation and semi panic worldwide as people resolve to change something or finally do that thing they planned to do X years ago. I used to be part of this well-meaning bunch who promised themselves and those around them that this new year would be different. It would be better. Of course lots of people manage to keep that resolve for a while before ditching it altogether. Psychologically, the need to be part of a mass decision-making hub is totally understandable. Makes you feel as if you’re fulfilling an unwritten global urge to make a change.\nBut why wait until the 31st day of the last month of any year or the 1st day of the first month of any year? You must realise by now that you just set yourself up to potentially fail (granted this doesn’t apply to everyone) or put unnecessary pressure on yourself to be defined by 12 arbitrary months. But that’s just how I have come to view the whole tradition of new year’s resolutions.\nSo what does a coach like me do instead? Well I start the first month of every year with a plan of what I need to do in the coming months; based on what I was trying to achieve the year before. I review how I got on with the previous year’s plans in terms of what goals still serve a purpose for me now, what else I need to do to accomplish that goal and what other goals I need to set to get closer to my ultimate long-term goal. Which then squarely forces me to identify and establish what that long-term goal should be! You see, we make goals all the time feeling at the time as if that thing we want to achieve is important.\nThat decision is often guided by things going on in our life at that point. If you periodically revisit that arch goal, you may realise that it isn’t serving your own greater good. It (the goal) may have ceased to matter. But because you are committed to seeing it through, you carry on regardless. Fast forward to new year’s eve and you may feel unaccomplished if you didn’t manage to achieve that goal, the very goal that wasn’t really any use to you anyway. For example, you may have wanted to stop drinking, lose weight, stop hanging out with that friend that drains you or change that job you hate. I’m not saying those goals don’t matter. Yet once you really examine why you set those goals in the first place, you might find that it isn’t the most important change you need to make at that point in your life.\nInstead, continuously look at the changes you want to make and ask yourself why. What will that change do for you. What will it not do. Does it matter if you don’t make that change. How important is it for you to make that change. How hard are you willing to work to get that thing you want? Answer those questions and you will find your direction. The last two questions will also show you that you don’t need to wait until new year’s eve to make that resolve to change. Change is continous. All year round. It can start in February. August. November. The main thing is to understand the purpose of the goal you’re setting, decide how important it is, make a plan, stick some dates in the plan so you are accountable and have fun realising the dream you wrote for yoursel.\nHappy 2017!"}}}
